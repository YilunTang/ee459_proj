Some notes for programming PCF8563, for future programming efforts.

Other important information are already contained in datasheet: https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/data-sheet/PCF8563.pdf
So this note will not contain them.

1. Remember to initialize / clear off all registers before putting data in.

2. This note file comes with some online coding examples. Those online coding examples Do Not work, because we don't have
the <Wire.h> library. So instead we have to use i2c functions, already contained in i2c.h and i2c.o. The functions there were
written by professor Allan Weber. 

3. In order to communicate with RTC, every i2c message (?) need to be prepended by the target register's internal address. Treat
this as part of the message. So in order to use i2c_io, the parameter should be something like this:

[device address (0xA3 default)],[target register internal address],...
... [1(for the length of targeted internal address)],[message],[message length]......

It is unknown whether it is function i2c_io's problem of missing characters when transmitting multiple characters, or LCD's problem
to receive / print them. So be careful when doing so. 

4. To be continued
